Corrected minor bug for improperly formed warning message when a\n%     book was not given a title. Thanks to Ming Kin Lai for reporting this.\n%  2. Added support for CTLname_format_string and CTLname_latex_cmd fields\n%     in the BST control entry type.\n%\n% 1.11 (2003/04/02)\n%  1. Fixed bug with URLs containing underscores when using url.sty. Thanks\n%     to Ming Kin Lai for reporting this.\n%\n% 1.12 (2007/01/11)\n%  1.

(Note: IEEEtran.bst does not need\n% or use the newline/newblock feature, but it has been implemented for\n% possible future use.) The output states of IEEEtran.bst consist of\n% multiple independent attributes and, as such, can be thought of as being\n% vectors, rather than the simple scalar values (\"before.all\", \n% \"mid.sentence\", etc.) used in most other .bst files.\n% \n% The more flexible and complex design used here was motivated in part by\n% IEEE's rather unusual bibliography style. For example, IEEE ends the\n% previous field item with a period and large space prior to the publisher\n% address; the @electronic entry types use periods as inter-item punctuation\n% rather than the commas used by the other entry types; and URLs are never\n% followed by periods even though they are the last item in the entry.\n% Although it is possible to accommodate these features with the conventional\n% output state system, the seemingly endless exceptions make for convoluted,\n% unreliable and difficult to maintain code.\n%\n% IEEEtran.bst's output state system can be easily understood via a simple\n% illustration of two most recently formatted entry fields (on the stack):\n%\n%               CURRENT_ITEM\n%               \"PREVIOUS_ITEM\n%\n% which, in this example, is to eventually appear in the bibliography as:\n% \n%               \"PREVIOUS_ITEM,\" CURRENT_ITEM\n%\n% It is the job of the output routine to take the previous item off of the\n% stack (while leaving the current item at the top of the stack), apply its\n% trailing punctuation (including closing quote marks) and spacing, and then\n% to write the result to BibTeX's output buffer:\n% \n%               \"PREVIOUS_ITEM,\" \n% \n% Punctuation (and spacing) between items is often determined by both of the\n% items rather than just the first one. The presence of quotation marks\n% further complicates the situation because, in standard English, trailing\n% punctuation marks are supposed to be contained within the quotes.\n% \n% IEEEtran.bst maintains two output state (aka \"status\") vectors which\n% correspond to the previous and current (aka \"this\") items. Each vector\n% consists of several independent attributes which track punctuation,\n% spacing, quotation, and newlines. Capitalization status is handled by a\n% separate scalar because the format routines, not the output routine,\n% handle capitalization and, therefore, there is no need to maintain the\n% capitalization attribute for both the \"previous\" and \"this\" items.\n% \n% When a format routine adds a new item, it copies the current output status\n% vector to the previous output status vector and (usually) resets the\n% current (this) output status vector to a \"standard status\" vector. Using a\n% \"standard status\" vector in this way allows us to redefine what we mean by\n% \"standard status\" at the start of each entry handler and reuse the same\n% format routines under the various inter-item separation schemes. For\n% example, the standard status vector for the @book entry type may use\n% commas for item separators, while the @electronic type may use periods,\n% yet both entry handlers exploit many of the exact same format routines.\n% \n% Because format routines have write access to the output status vector of\n% the previous item, they can override the punctuation choices of the\n% previous format routine! Therefore, it becomes trivial to implement rules\n% such as \"Always use a period and a large space before the publisher.\" By\n% pushing the generation of the closing quote mark to the output routine, we\n% avoid all the problems caused by having to close a quote before having all\n% the information required to determine what the punctuation should be.\n%\n% The IEEEtran.bst output state system can easily be expanded if needed.\n% For instance, it is easy to add a \"space.tie\" attribute value if the\n% bibliography rules mandate that two items have to be joined with an\n% unbreakable space. \n\nFUNCTION {initialize.status.constants}\n{ #0 'punct.no :=\n  #1 'punct.comma :=\n  #2 'punct.period :=\n  #0 'space.no := \n  #1 'space.normal :=\n  #2 'space.large :=\n  #0 'quote.no :=\n  #1 'quote.close :=\n  #0 'cap.no :=\n  #1 'cap.yes :=\n  #0 'nline.no :=\n  #1 'nline.newblock :=\n}\n\nFUNCTION {std.status.using.comma}\n{ punct.comma 'punct.std :=\n  space.normal 'space.std :=\n  quote.no 'quote.std :=\n  nline.no 'nline.std :=\n  cap.no 'cap.std :=\n}\n\nFUNCTION {std.status.using.period}\n{ punct.period 'punct.std :=\n  space.normal 'space.std :=\n  quote.no 'quote.std :=\n  nline.no 'nline.std :=\n  cap.yes 'cap.std :=\n}\n\nFUNCTION {initialize.prev.this.status}\n{ punct.no 'prev.status.punct :=\n  space.no 'prev.status.space :=\n  quote.no 'prev.status.quote :=\n  nline.no 'prev.status.nline :=\n  punct.no 'this.status.punct :=\n  space.no 'this.status.space :=\n  quote.no 'this.status.quote :=\n  nline.no 'this.status.nline :=\n  cap.yes 'status.cap :=\n}\n\nFUNCTION {this.status.std}\n{ punct.std 'this.status.punct :=\n  space.std 'this.status.space :=\n  quote.std 'this.status.quote :=\n  nline.std 'this.status.nline :=\n}\n\nFUNCTION {cap.status.std}{ cap.std 'status.cap := }\n\nFUNCTION {this.to.prev.status}\n{ this.status.punct 'prev.status.punct :=\n  this.status.space 'prev.status.space :=\n  this.status.quote 'prev.status.quote :=\n  this.status.nline 'prev.status.nline :=\n}\n\n\nFUNCTION {not}\n{   { #0 }\n    { #1 }\n  if$\n}\n\nFUNCTION {and}\n{   { skip$ }\n    { pop$ #0 }\n  if$\n}\n\nFUNCTION {or}\n{   { pop$ #1 }\n    { skip$ }\n  if$\n}\n\n\n% convert the strings \"yes\" or \"no\" to #1 or #0 respectively\nFUNCTION {yes.no.to.int}\n{ \"l\" change.case$ duplicate$\n    \"yes\" =\n    { pop$  #1 }\n    { duplicate$ \"no\" =\n        { pop$ #0 }\n        { \"unknown boolean \" quote$ * swap$ * quote$ *\n          \" in \" * cite$ * warning$\n          #0\n        }\n      if$\n    }\n  if$\n}\n\n\n% pushes true if the single char string on the stack is in the\n% range of \"0\" to \"9\"\nFUNCTION {is.num}\n{ chr.to.int$\n  duplicate$ \"0\" chr.to.int$ < not\n  swap$ \"9\" chr.to.int$ > not and\n}\n\n% multiplies the integer on the stack by a factor of 10\nFUNCTION {bump.int.mag}\n{ #0 'multiresult :=\n    { duplicate$ #0 > }\n    { #1 -\n      multiresult #10 +\n      'multiresult :=\n    }\n  while$\npop$\nmultiresult\n}\n\n% converts a single character string on the stack to an integer\nFUNCTION {char.to.integer}\n{ duplicate$ \n  is.num\n    { chr.to.int$ \"0\" chr.to.int$ - }\n    {\"noninteger character \" quote$ * swap$ * quote$ *\n          \" in integer field of \" * cite$ * warning$\n    #0\n    }\n  if$\n}\n\n% converts a string on the stack to an integer\nFUNCTION {string.to.integer}\n{ duplicate$ text.length$ 'namesleft :=\n  #1 'nameptr :=\n  #0 'numnames :=\n    { nameptr namesleft > not }\n    { duplicate$ nameptr #1 substring$\n      char.to.integer numnames bump.int.mag +\n      'numnames :=\n      nameptr #1 +\n      'nameptr :=\n    }\n  while$\npop$\nnumnames\n}\n\n\n\n\n% The output routines write out the *next* to the top (previous) item on the\n% stack, adding punctuation and such as needed.
