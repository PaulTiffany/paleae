# Integrating Paleae with Developer Tools

This guide explains how Paleae complements your existing development workflow. Instead of replacing tools like Git, `ripgrep`, or CI/CD systems, Paleae enhances them by providing a clean, structured, and AI-ready **Python code snapshot** for analysis and reporting.

## Version Control Systems

### Git, Mercurial, SVN

- **What they do:** Track code history and manage collaboration.
- **What Paleae adds:** Creates point-in-time, [AI-ready snapshots](Output-Format) of your codebase, perfect for analyzing changes or providing context to an LLM.

**Integration Strategy:** Use Git hooks to automatically generate a snapshot on each commit. See the [Cookbook](Cookbook) for practical script examples.

## Archive Tools

### zip, tar, 7z

- **What they do:** Compress and bundle files.
- **What Paleae adds:** Intelligently [filters content](Configuration) and adds [structured metadata](Output-Format) to create a machine-readable snapshot, not just a dumb archive.

**Integration Strategy:** When creating a release, generate both a `.zip` archive for users and a Paleae snapshot for automated analysis and bill-of-materials reporting.

## Text Processing Tools

### grep, ripgrep, ag

- **What they do:** Find specific lines of text in files.
- **What Paleae adds:** Provides the full, structured context of the entire codebase, which is essential for effective LLM analysis.

**Integration Strategy:** Use a fast search tool like `ripgrep` to find a list of relevant files, then pipe that list to Paleae to create a highly focused snapshot for debugging or review.

---

## CI/CD Pipelines

### GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI

- **What they do:** Automate the build, test, and deployment process.
- **What Paleae adds:** A reliable way to generate a consistent **codebase snapshot** for analysis at any stage of the pipeline.

**Integration Strategy:** Add a step in your CI pipeline to generate a snapshot using the [`--profile ai_optimized`](Configuration). This snapshot can then be passed to a security scanner, a code reviewer AI, or archived as a build artifact. See the [Advanced Usage](Advanced-Usage) guide for a complete GitHub Actions example.
